BACKUP 20 IS WORKING

21-backup: added silence-thres, tempo is 120, working fine

22-backup: complexmod works, timbrestamp works, added soft vlines on receive switches to prevent clips, almost changed fd_switched functionality...

23-backup: specdelays are finally working...

24-backup: phasevocoder is working but i need to implement how it interacts

25-backup: backuping before making the 6 channel turn

26-backup: enabled 6 channel input. phasevocoder: resizing tables creates POPS. Never do that live...

27-backup: recording and phasevocoding makes a lot of crackling sounds, so i might disable it altogether... also added fd_oxygen-49 abstraction, to enable midi input, but it's laggy on the gui side

28-backup: still get pops, but everything seems to work

29-backup: works

30-backup: yes, it works

31-backup: worked throughout 2nd rehearsal. kept fiddling with the *goto* functionality of fd_clicktrack and fd_midiread... it sshould automatically allow you to move across barnumers and eventnumbers by only choosing barnumbers. Also, phasevocoders are rather loud and i cannot control the levels, which is highly important. Why did i not include an oscillator filter bank, do you remember?

32-backup: working patch, use this for performance. the next patch will have different window types for the phasevocoder

33-backup: window changes are fine as long as they are in the reading of the fft tables

34-backup: working the video

35-backup: sigmundbuffer, but i dont like what it looks like

36-backup: really nice galaxy type sound analysis

37-backup: before switching to network setup

38-backup: video barks work
