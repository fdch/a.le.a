This music was generated using the a.le.a library for puredata written and played by the composer. The library uses an algorithm for swarm behavior together with the lorenz attractor in such a way that five boids/birds follow the famous chaotic attractor. The a.le.a library provides an interface to monitor and interact with both the lorenz and the boids paths, therefore enabling another -human- element on the movement of the birds: the player of the meta-score (the composer). This interface records result of the interaction of the triad (player, boids, attractor) in both a video file and a text file. The video us used for part of the visual aspect of the performance, and the text is used to generate a set of four meta-scores which indicate curves of transition between three elements (in this case, the electronics, the instrumental and the visual). It aims at being not a 'mapping' of the motion of the birds into musical structures, but as the triggering of events and transitions based on some properties of the line that goes through all the birds. The instrumental score is then interpreted from this output into hand-crafted gestural snippets of Lilypond code (via the [notes] external for puredata) which belong to each of the six instruments of the ensemble. This interpretation produces four full-scores (one for each meta-score). For this performance, the composer hand-trimmed and re-interpreted some absurdly incoherent blobs of ink on the page into musical absurdly incoherent gestures, choosing from all of the four fullscores arriving at a final score. The electronics and the video follow a similar procedure, but are mostly generated live, taking the third -human- element from the real-time feed of the players. a.le.a is, therefore, not a work, it is the unworking of a work. It is not only the performative result in itself, but also the path of its unworking. The spectator is invited to listen for these traces.
