#TO DO
##Parts
- [x] Make a part command to obtain a score for each part
##Frescobaldi Workspace
- [x] Make a frescobaldi workspace that includes all parts and score, and the definitions files
##Ottavas in Piano
- [x] Automate pianoL \ottava #2...0 and pianoR \ottava #-1...0
##Edit pd
- [x] edit instrument abstraction in pd so that the modulo scales morph incrementally into markov scales
- [x] correct dynamic inputs. dont place dynamics in rests... avoid conecutive dynamics
##Edit pd
- [] place TEMPO changes accordingly
- [] setup e-define, v-define to more accurate representations. No diads. More dynamic information. These files will be mostly for MIDI information, so anything that can be read with mrpeach/midifile will be very important to have.
