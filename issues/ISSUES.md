# LAST BAR BARCHECK BY [NOTES]

## 1. Problem

Concatenating <_part.ly> files generates barcheck warnings and this makes the score less readable when lilypond interprets it.

## Possible approach

I suggest [notes] fills the bar with missing values.

## 2. Problem

Chords tied together prevent the **ottaver.ly** Scheme to set the ottava lines.

## 3. Problem

[notes] refdur 8 doesn't seem to work.

## 4. Proglem: consecutive legato markings...

## 5. Problem: wrong range definition for piano



## Problem: ottavate setup should be:  \ottavate #'(2 . 7) #'(-2 . -6) ##t
